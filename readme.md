# One to one, persistent Spring Boot Chat Service

This project is a chat application developed using Spring Boot, WebSocket and PostgreSQL. It is different than the other chat application examples you can find on the web. Most of the tutorials on chat application using Spring Boot are just chat rooms. But usually one to one, persistent chat application is required for projects.

The modules other than the chat module in the application are not detailed. Because the logic in the chat module is wanted to be highlighted.

If you want to see how it works in a web application, you can see the client project of this service via [this link](https://github.com/samfatu/chat-client). This client application is developed using React and WebSocket is used.

These two repository can be a decent example of persistent, one to one chat using Spring Boot + React + PostgreSQL stack.
